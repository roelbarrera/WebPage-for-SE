Hello students,

The goal of this assignment is to take one of the ideas
you submitted (or a new one) and develop a home page for it.

In order to do this, you must use Bootstrap 4 and start with the template provided.

Here are the things I want for you to do:

1. Change the contents of the <title></title> tag
2. Have a cool headline and subheadline that gets across your unique value proposition and tells (or lets
the reader infer) what the problem is.
3. Add a link under the subheadline for people to sign up / buy / try, you know the drill.
4. Under that stuff add a row with three columns. In each of those columns have a headline, text,
and a call to action (either a link or a button) describing 3 things. Either 3 features, 3 problems you solve,
3 types of customers it might be good for, 3 something!
5. Under that add a section describing the solution. Be creative in how you design this section.
6. Add a section describing pricing and add another call to action (sign up / buy / try, etc)
